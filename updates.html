                                This first week was very eventful. While there was not much progress made in the actual project, the team was able to get a plan for what they need to do in order to get a satisfied customer.
                                <br> After meeting with the customer, it was decided that the team would first focus on giving an existing game called Centipede Chromecast support. If that was successfully completed, then the team would focus on making their own game that has Chromecast support. Getting the Chromecast to work with a game is the main goal, whether that be our own game or the preexisting one. The team and the customer are getting along well, and the project will be successfully completed if our plan is followed well.
                                <br> The team had a primary meeting on Friday to work on the website and get adjusted to using GitHub as the main communication source. Roxanne taught us how we can use GitHub and what we should do to help with the project. We also discussed future meetings and what we plan to get done at the next meeting. Overall, the team is getting along very well and is appearing to be a very functional team.

                                Following the assignment of projects, the team met with Chad McQuillen to discuss the goals for the  project. He outlined what he would like to see out of the team for the coming semester, as well as  offered advice and pointers. After the meeting, the team summarized what had been discussed into a list of goals. The list was e-mailed to Chad McQuillen who replyed with an e-mail of approval later that day.
                                <br> The following weekend, on February 4th, Roxanne and I met to start tentative exploration with the chromecast. Our goal was to learn about how the chromecast works with different devices, and experiment with pre-existing chromecast games. While we did not progress to creating our own content for the device, we gained a basic understanding of the mechanics.
                                <br> Our first official team meeting occured on Thursday, February 9th. We created the framework for the project wesite and wrote the first draft for the site content, including the project requirements and schedule. We also synced up our github accounts and reviewed the basics of git.

                                Uploaded several examples to repositories on github to be hosted while running Chromecast examples. Worked with changing app id's, registering different host locations, etc... No examples seem to work after inputing our own code to our custom receivers. Watched several tutorial videos and commented on forums. Seems not a lot of people have been developing with Chromecast Custom Receivers in recent years.
