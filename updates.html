                                The game can now be casted to the television, which is amazing. The next step is to get key presses to register so that the game can actually be played. A issue that could prove to be really bad is that we cannot seem to find a way to cast from the chrome browser on a mobile device. That means that we cannot use the phone as a controller. This was the goal all along, so we need to gind a way to get aroudn this so that the controller can be the phone. These next few weeks will be very important for that.

                                This past week was spring break, and unfortunately the group was not able to meet at all during this time due to prior commitments. The week before theat though, was the presentation in front of class. The presentation went according to plan and was well received. It was also a good practice for what the final presentation will be like. During this week the group also made the final changes to design and planning so that everything is set up to finally get started on the guts of the project. These next couple weeks are going to be busy, but exciting.

                                This past week was very good for the group. The group worked on finalizing the design for the project so that a clear plan of what we must do to finish the project on time. Part of this process was creating a midterm presentation that will be presented during class next week. The group also met with Presentation U and went over the presentation. The meeting was very helpful and the group got some tips on the presentation as a whole. A major decision was also made. The focus of the project will now be switched to implementing the Centipede game and updating the user experience as a whole. This was discussed with the customer and he approved. As of now, everything looks good for the future.

                                Unfortunately, the group was not able to meet this week due to family emergencies. During this week, however, there was still progress made by the group members that were available to work. Nate was able to finally find the issue that the team had with getting changes to apply to sample applications provided by google. It took quite a bit of tinkering, but the team is finally ready to get working on more exciting aspects. The main focus for the next week is to get a presentation ready for the midterm presentations in class in a little over a week. Once a design is finished, the presentation will be ready to go.

                                We registered Nate's Chromecast with the Google Cast Developer SDK console and worked with Google's examples on how to build a custom receiver. The samples would not work the way that we expected, so we are confused as to what the best process is from here on out. We have contacted many different people in hopes that we can figure something out, but we are waiting on replies at the moment. Hopefully we can get somewhere soon, as this is a key step in our process.

                                Created project website, synched up github accounts, wrote first draft of requirements page, updated team bios. Held first official team meeting at coffea 2/8/2017. This meeting was very successful as it helped the team get more acquainted with each other. Everyone seems hardworking and determined to get a good result from this project, so we are excited to work together. We have found quite a bit of documentation online, which is promising. However, we are still concerned about getting an entire game up and running with the often difficult to work with chromecast. We believe it will be doable, and that we will finish everything on time.

                                We have finally got the game to display on the Chromecast. This may sound like we are done, but this is just the first step. Right now the game can be accessed, but after that nothing works. The good thing, though, is that progress is being made with the project itself and after some minor tweaks the game should be playable on the screen. A roadblock that we ran into is that we cannot find a cast option on the mobile versions of chrome. This is a major issue and could really change what happens in the next few weeks. The main goal now is to get key presses to register, but after that we have to find a way to control it using the phone.

                                This update will be about the previous 2 weeks, instead of the usual 1 week. One of these weeks was spring break, and due to prior commitments the group was not able to meet at all during this time. So there is nothing to update about that week. The week before that was the class presentation. It went very well! The group felt good about what was presented and how it was received. Other than the presentation, there were some minor advances in the project. Everything is finally set up to get to the main part of the project. Up until now the group was stuck on logistics of the Chromecast, but now that that has been resolved, the real project can begin. The current plan is to start working this next week and continue until we are ready for the final presentations in a little over a month.

                                We met earlier in the week to go over our current project progress and finalize design decisions. During this time we were able to get a presentation ready that will be used next Wednesday when we present our project to the class. During this presentation creation we were also able to get a design going that we would put on the website Monday. Later in the week the group finished the design using an online document. On Friday the group met with Presentation U and practiced the presentation in front of the tutor. She gave us some good advice on both presenting and the presentation itself. It was very successful. Next week we will prepare for our presentation and start the groundwork for the project itself. We are currently on schedule to finish.

                                While we did not physically meet this week, I worked on figuring out the issues that had been hurting us since the beginning. I worked with getting modifications to apply to the sample applications provided by google. After switching settings around, viewing the console, rebooting and ubdating everything, talking to multiple experts online, and changing some small bits of code I was finally able to get the changes in the receiver to stay and work with the sender.
                                <br>
                                <br>From here we will finally be able to start working on the centipede project. This is a major breakthrough in the project because this small issue had been holding us back for a little over a week now. I am hoping that after we finish the design and presentation this week, that we will be able to get a big jump on the actual coding so that we can finish on time.

                                So far the project has been a confusing adventure. This week specifically we ran into a lot of issues when we tried to change code in existing projects. We would use sample projects provided by Google and see that they worked with our registered device. The applications would also work when we changed the app id to the id that we got from registering the application. Whenever we tried to change the code in the receiver app the system would no longer work. There is no explanation for this and we are researching possible issues.
                                <br>
                                <br>We contacted our customer and reached out to Google's cast developer support in hopes that we can figure out this issue. As of now we are at a major roadblock in the project and need to figure out a way to get this past this. The issues could be from registration, github integration issues, or even a hardware issue. At this point we cannot rule anything out. We plan to meet again within the week to troubleshoot more.

                                This first week was very eventful. While there was not much progress made in the actual project, the team was able to get a plan for what they need to do in order to get a satisfied customer.
                                <br>
                                <br>After meeting with the customer, it was decided that the team would first focus on giving an existing game called Centipede Chromecast support. If that was successfully completed, then the team would focus on making their own game that has Chromecast support. Getting the Chromecast to work with a game is the main goal, whether that be our own game or the preexisting one. The team and the customer are getting along well, and the project will be successfully completed if our plan is followed well.
                                <br>
                                <br>The team had a primary meeting on Friday to work on the website and get adjusted to using GitHub as the main communication source. Roxanne taught us how we can use GitHub and what we should do to help with the project. We also discussed future meetings and what we plan to get done at the next meeting. Overall, the team is getting along very well and is appearing to be a very functional team.

                           The whole group met on Wednesday (3/29). Not a lot of progress was made. Roxanne and I met the follwing day (3/30) and made
                           significant progress. We removed the instruction screen, and the game successful displayed and updated. The character also
                           will move based on html button presses that we added. However, it would continue to move endlessly on a button press. Nate
                           and I met on Saturday (4/1) and made slight progess. We looked at the testing plan that Nate had written. We also looked at
                           ways to implement a button to cast the tab, so that the game can be cast from a mobile device.
                           The whole group met again on Sunday (4/2) and worked out several bugs. We added a function to make sure the character only
                           moves once per button press. We also implemented a button that will pause the game. We also changed the game implementation so
                           the character will respawn a few seconds after death. Our current focus will be to fix the game so it is playable on mobile,
                           if the chromecast will support this. We will also be changing the sender page to have instructions displayed before the user presses
                           the start/cast button. We will also begin focusing on the graphical aspect of the project. We will be bringing the game up to UX
                           standards, as well as the look of the controller page.

                            With the development environment finally set up, the group met and started editing the existing project to add chromecast support. We have an outline to begin coding and will need to divide of the work from here. I am currently having trouble with the project working on my computer, but the rest of the group is not. We have also been working to perfect our usage of github as versioning control for our project.

                                Spring break was a dead period for the team, as we did not meet or work on the project together. The week before that was our presentation and it went very well. During this week the group also did the finishing touches on the project plan and we are finally ready to begin work on the game itself.

The group met on the 2nd to work on the midterm presentation. We also met on the 3rd to practice the presentation with eStudio. Roxanne and I met on March 5th to polish the design.

                                The team did not meet this week, due to extenuating circumstances. The group divided up parts of the design to work on, to continue to make progress separately. Nate managed to gt a sample working on the chromecast after altering it. It's believed that switching chrome into developer mode or recreating the repository helped.

                                The team met today to further study custom receivers on the chromecast. We looked at several examples provided by the chromecast team. We experimented with the registration process of applications. We also looked at the placement of app ids and namespaces. Applications would work with our registered app ids until the example code was modified. Forums contained no recent posts about developing with the chromecast.

                                Following the assignment of projects, the team met with Chad McQuillen to discuss the goals for the  project. He outlined what he would like to see out of the team for the coming semester, as well as  offered advice and pointers. After the meeting, the team summarized what had been discussed into a list of goals. The list was e-mailed to Chad McQuillen who replyed with an e-mail of approval later that day.
                                <br> The following weekend, on February 4th, Roxanne and I met to start tentative exploration with the chromecast. Our goal was to learn about how the chromecast works with different devices, and experiment with pre-existing chromecast games. While we did not progress to creating our own content for the device, we gained a basic understanding of the mechanics.
                                <br> Our first official team meeting occured on Thursday, February 9th. We created the framework for the project wesite and wrote the first draft for the site content, including the project requirements and schedule. We also synced up our github accounts and reviewed the basics of git.

                              Met with Nikki and Nate on Wednesday 3/29 to get the game to play by casting a tab onto the chromecast and not a lot happened except grandiose frustration. Nikki and I met the next night; however, and got the game to show up on the screen as well as get the player to move if we press a button on the sender.html page. However, when it moved it would just move left forever without quitting. On Sunday we all met together and got it to work so that when you move the character, he only moves once per button push. We then added all the other buttons like left, right, up, down and fire. We also added pausing functionality! Right now it seems our project is ahead of schedule and we will be focusing on the design aspect of the game as well as making it compatible for mobile. Currenly it does not work on an android phone, but we are going to focus right now on getting all the UX standards first. I am very excited about how much we got done this week and am very happy to start moving forward on what I think are some of the more fun parts of game design -> the actual game design.

                          We worked on getting everyone's environments set up to be able to start independently working on the project. Now that we've gotten it working so we can make an editable app, we have to figure out how we're going to divide the rest of the project. After Nate got it to work on his device, Nikki and I tried repeating the process on our devices. It seems as if everything is working well on my end, we just need to get it where Nikki can work on it. We also need to work on getting it so we are all on working on the same repo on Github. I worked with researching how to create branches on github and work on microreleases. So far it seems we are going to do it without creating a forked copy, so its a little different than how people standardly work with github; however, since we are such a small team it will do. I also worked on graphics for the game and am going to plug those in as soon as we start real development.

                                The presentation was two weeks ago, and the group performed as expected. All the information was given and received well by the audience. The team also made the finishing touches on what the future will look like. We are set up to do well in the next few weeks. Last week was spring break, so the team did not meet during this time.

                                Met with group @coffea on 2/28 to create slideshow for design presentation this upcoming Wednesday. Worked on creating diagrams on Illustrator to show how communication works between devices. Finished wireframing and user scenarios for the project design due 3/7. Put on design document on /project.html under the Design tab. Met with Nikki to work on getting the next phase of project working. Figured out that we have to use Nate's developer account to get anything working. Decided what is going to be divided between us for the next couple weeks. Planning on getting artwork done for userscreens to update game.

                                Unable to meet with group this week due to personal issues. Divided up tasks to tackle on the design due next week. Began work on developing user stories and wireframing as well as organizing information for class presentation.

                                Uploaded several examples to repositories on github to be hosted while running Chromecast examples. Worked with changing app id's, registering different host locations, etc... No examples seem to work after inputing our own code to our custom receivers. Watched several tutorial videos and commented on forums. Seems not a lot of people have been developing with Chromecast Custom Receivers in recent years.
