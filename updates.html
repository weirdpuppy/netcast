                                The team met quite a bit this week, as it is nearing the end of the semester. The team needed to get all of the loose ends tied up and finish the project. On Wednesday night the group met and worked on getting some of the redesign implemented. Thursday the team met again and worked on the presentation that they would be practicing the next day. They also worked on various small parts of the project documentation. Friday the team had the practice presentation and received good feedback. Sunday afternoon the group met again to finish the project. Roxanne worked on the redesign as a whole. Nikki and Nate worked together to finish the final document. The group also shot video for a demo they had been working on. The team is almost done, they will be working on the practice presentation next week.

                                This week the group worked independently. Nate worked on making outlines for the final documentation and final presentation. The group will meet later on to look at these items as a whole and make final changes to them. Nate also worked on the testing documentation. Roxanne worked on the redesign of the game, making new sprites and menus. Nikki worked on the commenting of everything and research on an android app implementation. The group met once on Wednesday with their professor to discuss the projects coding aspects. Overall, a successful week.

                                The group had a testing review with the instructor. During this meeting we all went over the current testing plan and what can be improved overall. These suggestions were taken into consideration, when Nate was working om the testing document. Roxanne worked on making the game look better, specifically the controller and splash screen. Nikki worked on commenting the code we have made, including the code that was provided from the beginning. The group met on Sunday to get the rest of the semester planned out. The game is working with the chromecast when using a computer, but we are having issues getting it to work with phones. From here on out we will be looking into final documentation and possibly implementing an android application.

                                The group met on Wednesday, but didn't really make any progress. The meeting was long, but nothing was really accomplished. Roxanne and Nikki met on Thursday to work more with it and found a way to get keypresses to register between the sender and receiver. Nate worked on the testing document and plan during this time. Nate and Nikki met on the Saturday to get caught up with each other and start work on some more key press handling. Sunday the entire group was able to meet again. This is where the magic happened. Many features were added, and bugs fixed. Right now the game is playable using a computer as the controller and hte Tv as the display. This is an amazing accomplishment. For now, the goeal is to get it to work with Android phones, as that was the initial goal. If this is not doable, the project will be adjusted.

                                The game can now be casted to the television, which is amazing. The next step is to get key presses to register so that the game can actually be played. A issue that could prove to be really bad is that we cannot seem to find a way to cast from the chrome browser on a mobile device. That means that we cannot use the phone as a controller. This was the goal all along, so we need to gind a way to get aroudn this so that the controller can be the phone. These next few weeks will be very important for that.

                                This past week was spring break, and unfortunately the group was not able to meet at all during this time due to prior commitments. The week before theat though, was the presentation in front of class. The presentation went according to plan and was well received. It was also a good practice for what the final presentation will be like. During this week the group also made the final changes to design and planning so that everything is set up to finally get started on the guts of the project. These next couple weeks are going to be busy, but exciting.

                                This past week was very good for the group. The group worked on finalizing the design for the project so that a clear plan of what we must do to finish the project on time. Part of this process was creating a midterm presentation that will be presented during class next week. The group also met with Presentation U and went over the presentation. The meeting was very helpful and the group got some tips on the presentation as a whole. A major decision was also made. The focus of the project will now be switched to implementing the Centipede game and updating the user experience as a whole. This was discussed with the customer and he approved. As of now, everything looks good for the future.

                                Unfortunately, the group was not able to meet this week due to family emergencies. During this week, however, there was still progress made by the group members that were available to work. Nate was able to finally find the issue that the team had with getting changes to apply to sample applications provided by google. It took quite a bit of tinkering, but the team is finally ready to get working on more exciting aspects. The main focus for the next week is to get a presentation ready for the midterm presentations in class in a little over a week. Once a design is finished, the presentation will be ready to go.

                                We registered Nate's Chromecast with the Google Cast Developer SDK console and worked with Google's examples on how to build a custom receiver. The samples would not work the way that we expected, so we are confused as to what the best process is from here on out. We have contacted many different people in hopes that we can figure something out, but we are waiting on replies at the moment. Hopefully we can get somewhere soon, as this is a key step in our process.

                                Created project website, synched up github accounts, wrote first draft of requirements page, updated team bios. Held first official team meeting at coffea 2/8/2017. This meeting was very successful as it helped the team get more acquainted with each other. Everyone seems hardworking and determined to get a good result from this project, so we are excited to work together. We have found quite a bit of documentation online, which is promising. However, we are still concerned about getting an entire game up and running with the often difficult to work with chromecast. We believe it will be doable, and that we will finish everything on time.

                                I worked on the final documentation and testing this week. I also helped with the final presentation practice which we then actually practiced on Friday. We met Wednesday and Thursday as well, to work on the redesign and the documentation. Sunday we all met. Roxanne finished up her redesign implementation. Nikki and I worked on the final document. We are done with all of that now and are ready to present next week. The video that will be put into our presentation to demo the game was shot Sunday as well. We shot all the raw footage and it is ready to be edited together. I was the star of the video, where I am playing the game.

                                During the past week we met once as a team. When we met, we met with our professor to discuss how our code works overall, looking at comments and etiquette. Other than that, we worked independently. I worked on getting the testing finalized. Once I was done with that, I worked on making outlines that we could follow for the final presentation and the final documentation. Nikki worked on commenting the rest of the project. Roxanne worked on the redesign, including sprites for the game.

                                During this past week I worked on the testing documentation, making it flow better and have a better overall plan laid out. During this time I also looked into android implementation, with little luck overall. We met on Wednesday with the instructor to discuss our testing plan (this is where I got the ideas for improvements). The group met on Sunday to work on some final touches with the project. We are happy with the project overall right now, but we are going to continue to look at the possibility of getting an android app to work.

                                There was a lot of meeting this week. The entire team met Wednesday with minimal results. Roxanne and Nikki met Thursday and found a way to send messages back and forth between the sender and receiver. During this time, I worked on the testing plan for the project for this time. Saturday Nikki and I met and got me caught up with what was finished. We also worked on some small bug fixes. Sunday we all met again and it really helped us a lot. We fixed a lot of major issues we were having. We gto the game to cast and run perectly when using a PC. The only major issue we have now is getting it to work on a mobile device. This was the main goal, but as of now it may not work. We will work the next few weeks to get this done.

                                We have finally got the game to display on the Chromecast. This may sound like we are done, but this is just the first step. Right now the game can be accessed, but after that nothing works. The good thing, though, is that progress is being made with the project itself and after some minor tweaks the game should be playable on the screen. A roadblock that we ran into is that we cannot find a cast option on the mobile versions of chrome. This is a major issue and could really change what happens in the next few weeks. The main goal now is to get key presses to register, but after that we have to find a way to control it using the phone.

                                This update will be about the previous 2 weeks, instead of the usual 1 week. One of these weeks was spring break, and due to prior commitments the group was not able to meet at all during this time. So there is nothing to update about that week. The week before that was the class presentation. It went very well! The group felt good about what was presented and how it was received. Other than the presentation, there were some minor advances in the project. Everything is finally set up to get to the main part of the project. Up until now the group was stuck on logistics of the Chromecast, but now that that has been resolved, the real project can begin. The current plan is to start working this next week and continue until we are ready for the final presentations in a little over a month.

                                We met earlier in the week to go over our current project progress and finalize design decisions. During this time we were able to get a presentation ready that will be used next Wednesday when we present our project to the class. During this presentation creation we were also able to get a design going that we would put on the website Monday. Later in the week the group finished the design using an online document. On Friday the group met with Presentation U and practiced the presentation in front of the tutor. She gave us some good advice on both presenting and the presentation itself. It was very successful. Next week we will prepare for our presentation and start the groundwork for the project itself. We are currently on schedule to finish.

                                While we did not physically meet this week, I worked on figuring out the issues that had been hurting us since the beginning. I worked with getting modifications to apply to the sample applications provided by google. After switching settings around, viewing the console, rebooting and ubdating everything, talking to multiple experts online, and changing some small bits of code I was finally able to get the changes in the receiver to stay and work with the sender.
                                <br>
                                <br>From here we will finally be able to start working on the centipede project. This is a major breakthrough in the project because this small issue had been holding us back for a little over a week now. I am hoping that after we finish the design and presentation this week, that we will be able to get a big jump on the actual coding so that we can finish on time.

                                So far the project has been a confusing adventure. This week specifically we ran into a lot of issues when we tried to change code in existing projects. We would use sample projects provided by Google and see that they worked with our registered device. The applications would also work when we changed the app id to the id that we got from registering the application. Whenever we tried to change the code in the receiver app the system would no longer work. There is no explanation for this and we are researching possible issues.
                                <br>
                                <br>We contacted our customer and reached out to Google's cast developer support in hopes that we can figure out this issue. As of now we are at a major roadblock in the project and need to figure out a way to get this past this. The issues could be from registration, github integration issues, or even a hardware issue. At this point we cannot rule anything out. We plan to meet again within the week to troubleshoot more.

                                This first week was very eventful. While there was not much progress made in the actual project, the team was able to get a plan for what they need to do in order to get a satisfied customer.
                                <br>
                                <br>After meeting with the customer, it was decided that the team would first focus on giving an existing game called Centipede Chromecast support. If that was successfully completed, then the team would focus on making their own game that has Chromecast support. Getting the Chromecast to work with a game is the main goal, whether that be our own game or the preexisting one. The team and the customer are getting along well, and the project will be successfully completed if our plan is followed well.
                                <br>
                                <br>The team had a primary meeting on Friday to work on the website and get adjusted to using GitHub as the main communication source. Roxanne taught us how we can use GitHub and what we should do to help with the project. We also discussed future meetings and what we plan to get done at the next meeting. Overall, the team is getting along very well and is appearing to be a very functional team.

                                The group did not meet this week. We had our code review on Wednesday (4/12). Upon deciding that the project needs no additional work, we agreed to work on the documentation and reports separately. Roxanne continued to improve then interface of the game. Nate continued working on testing. I began researching and gathering notes about the implementation of an android app to include in our final report. We plan to begin working on the slides for our final presentation this week and meeting Wednesday and Thursday to go through the presentation itself. From here, the focus will be on documentation and end-of-semester deliverables.

                                The whole group met on Sunday (4/9). Prior to this meeting I focused on commenting code, Roxanne focused on improving the graphics, and Nate worked on the testing documentation. This meeting primarily revolved around testing the splash screen and developing a plan for moving forward. The game is complete when considering the scope of playing the game on a device with the desktop version of chrome available. From here, an android app will be considered to allow for mobile functionality.

                                The whole group met on Wednesday (3/29). Not a lot of progress was made. Roxanne and I met the follwing day (3/30) and made significant progress. We removed the instruction screen, and the game successful displayed and updated. The character also will move based on html button presses that we added. However, it would continue to move endlessly on a button press. Nate and I met on Saturday (4/1) and made slight progess. We looked at the testing plan that Nate had written. We also looked at ways to implement a button to cast the tab, so that the game can be cast from a mobile device. The whole group met again on Sunday (4/2) and worked out several bugs. We added a function to make sure the character only moves once per button press. We also implemented a button that will pause the game. We also changed the game implementation so the character will respawn a few seconds after death. Our current focus will be to fix the game so it is playable on mobile, if the chromecast will support this. We will also be changing the sender page to have instructions displayed before the user presses the start/cast button. We will also begin focusing on the graphical aspect of the project. We will be bringing the game up to UX standards, as well as the look of the controller page.

                                With the development environment finally set up, the group met and started editing the existing project to add chromecast support. We have an outline to begin coding and will need to divide of the work from here. I am currently having trouble with the project working on my computer, but the rest of the group is not. We have also been working to perfect our usage of github as versioning control for our project.

                                Spring break was a dead period for the team, as we did not meet or work on the project together. The week before that was our presentation and it went very well. During this week the group also did the finishing touches on the project plan and we are finally ready to begin work on the game itself.

The group met on the 2nd to work on the midterm presentation. We also met on the 3rd to practice the presentation with eStudio. Roxanne and I met on March 5th to polish the design.

                                The team did not meet this week, due to extenuating circumstances. The group divided up parts of the design to work on, to continue to make progress separately. Nate managed to gt a sample working on the chromecast after altering it. It's believed that switching chrome into developer mode or recreating the repository helped.

                                The team met today to further study custom receivers on the chromecast. We looked at several examples provided by the chromecast team. We experimented with the registration process of applications. We also looked at the placement of app ids and namespaces. Applications would work with our registered app ids until the example code was modified. Forums contained no recent posts about developing with the chromecast.

                                Following the assignment of projects, the team met with Chad McQuillen to discuss the goals for the  project. He outlined what he would like to see out of the team for the coming semester, as well as  offered advice and pointers. After the meeting, the team summarized what had been discussed into a list of goals. The list was e-mailed to Chad McQuillen who replyed with an e-mail of approval later that day.
                                <br> The following weekend, on February 4th, Roxanne and I met to start tentative exploration with the chromecast. Our goal was to learn about how the chromecast works with different devices, and experiment with pre-existing chromecast games. While we did not progress to creating our own content for the device, we gained a basic understanding of the mechanics.
                                <br> Our first official team meeting occured on Thursday, February 9th. We created the framework for the project wesite and wrote the first draft for the site content, including the project requirements and schedule. We also synced up our github accounts and reviewed the basics of git.

                                Worked really hard on the design this week! Got everything right where I wanted it and I am really happy with it. I understand a lot more on how Randolph designed the original Centipede site and it was really fun to hack on it to suit our needs. I completely changed the dimensions the game is played on, fixed the size of the sprites, added the sprites in, added a cool background and frame, and editied the instructions and controller to be more dynamic so it can be better played on a tablet and makes more sense for the user. (We had a bunch of comments from customer testing that the buttons needed to be bigger and easier to touch). Nate, Nikki, and I met last Wednesday to work on the presentation and then also on Sunday. On Sunday Nate and Nikki worked predominately on the final paper while I hacked a bit more on the game to make it look even better. After this, we worked together to make the demo film that we will be showing for the final presentation. I have some experience with Adobe Premiere so I'll be the one putting the film together. I am at the point where I'm really proud of what we've done so now I just want to show it off to everyone! Though we didn't reach all of our original goals, I'm really humbled by how much work all this really takes! Signing off for probably the last time -Roxanne

                                There are just a few little details left on this project to work on. Besides the presentation and final report this thing is all but a few lines of code away from being finished. My sprites are ready to be plugged in and I am going to spend a few hours tonight updating the look of the game. We are also going to film a quick demo this week. Last week we were all pretty busy and couldn't meet because of Easter Weekend but we were diligently working on final touches remotely. I have already been showing off this project to my friends and family and am really glad I got to be a part of this team. Now all we got to do is publish it and share it at Marksbury! Yay!

                                Started development on the styles of sender.html. About to add the sprites I made to receiver.html. We are getting down to the end of the project and ready to start adding the finishing touches. I am so excited! Though it still doesn't work for mobile, The game is still really fun to play on on a touchscreen tablet or laptop. Also, working with the javascript to enhance the gaming experience has been really fun for me. We met on Sunday 4/9 and are looking to get the game finished completely by Easter. We have already begun the testing process and I am arranging for a cool demo film of the game to be shot with my friends and family playing the game themselves. So far I'm really proud of my growth as a developer and am really proud of my team, too. We've all come really far in the last few months and I think are better equipped to take on the world in front of us. Now if only we could get something working with mobile....

                                Met with Nikki and Nate on Wednesday 3/29 to get the game to play by casting a tab onto the chromecast and not a lot happened except grandiose frustration. Nikki and I met the next night; however, and got the game to show up on the screen as well as get the player to move if we press a button on the sender.html page. However, when it moved it would just move left forever without quitting. On Sunday we all met together and got it to work so that when you move the character, he only moves once per button push. We then added all the other buttons like left, right, up, down and fire. We also added pausing functionality! Right now it seems our project is ahead of schedule and we will be focusing on the design aspect of the game as well as making it compatible for mobile. Currenly it does not work on an android phone, but we are going to focus right now on getting all the UX standards first. I am very excited about how much we got done this week and am very happy to start moving forward on what I think are some of the more fun parts of game design -> the actual game design.

                                We worked on getting everyone's environments set up to be able to start independently working on the project. Now that we've gotten it working so we can make an editable app, we have to figure out how we're going to divide the rest of the project. After Nate got it to work on his device, Nikki and I tried repeating the process on our devices. It seems as if everything is working well on my end, we just need to get it where Nikki can work on it. We also need to work on getting it so we are all on working on the same repo on Github. I worked with researching how to create branches on github and work on microreleases. So far it seems we are going to do it without creating a forked copy, so its a little different than how people standardly work with github; however, since we are such a small team it will do. I also worked on graphics for the game and am going to plug those in as soon as we start real development.

                                The presentation was two weeks ago, and the group performed as expected. All the information was given and received well by the audience. The team also made the finishing touches on what the future will look like. We are set up to do well in the next few weeks. Last week was spring break, so the team did not meet during this time.

                                Met with group @coffea on 2/28 to create slideshow for design presentation this upcoming Wednesday. Worked on creating diagrams on Illustrator to show how communication works between devices. Finished wireframing and user scenarios for the project design due 3/7. Put on design document on /project.html under the Design tab. Met with Nikki to work on getting the next phase of project working. Figured out that we have to use Nate's developer account to get anything working. Decided what is going to be divided between us for the next couple weeks. Planning on getting artwork done for userscreens to update game.

                                Unable to meet with group this week due to personal issues. Divided up tasks to tackle on the design due next week. Began work on developing user stories and wireframing as well as organizing information for class presentation.

                                Uploaded several examples to repositories on github to be hosted while running Chromecast examples. Worked with changing app id's, registering different host locations, etc... No examples seem to work after inputing our own code to our custom receivers. Watched several tutorial videos and commented on forums. Seems not a lot of people have been developing with Chromecast Custom Receivers in recent years.
