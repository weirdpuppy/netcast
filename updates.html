                                Unfortunately, the group was not able to meet this week due to family emergencies. During this week, however, there was still progress made by the group members that were available to work. Nate was able to finally find the issue that the team had with getting changes to apply to sample applications provided by google. It took quite a bit of tinkering, but the team is finally ready to get working on more exciting aspects. The main focus for the next week is to get a presentation ready for the midterm presentations in class in a little over a week. Once a design is finished, the presentation will be ready to go.

                                We registered Nate's Chromecast with the Google Cast Developer SDK console and worked with Google's examples on how to build a custom receiver. The samples would not work the way that we expected, so we are confused as to what the best process is from here on out. We have contacted many different people in hopes that we can figure something out, but we are waiting on replies at the moment. Hopefully we can get somewhere soon, as this is a key step in our process.

                                Created project website, synched up github accounts, wrote first draft of requirements page, updated team bios. Held first official team meeting at coffea 2/8/2017. This meeting was very successful as it helped the team get more acquainted with each other. Everyone seems hardworking and determined to get a good result from this project, so we are excited to work together. We have found quite a bit of documentation online, which is promising. However, we are still concerned about getting an entire game up and running with the often difficult to work with chromecast. We believe it will be doable, and that we will finish everything on time.

                                While we did not physically meet this week, I worked on figuring out the issues that had been hurting us since the beginning. I worked with getting modifications to apply to the sample applications provided by google. After switching settings around, viewing the console, rebooting and ubdating everything, talking to multiple experts online, and changing some small bits of code I was finally able to get the changes in the receiver to stay and work with the sender. 
                                <br>
                                <br>From here we will finally be able to start working on the centipede project. This is a major breakthrough in the project because this small issue had been holding us back for a little over a week now. I am hoping that after we finish the design and presentation this week, that we will be able to get a big jump on the actual coding so that we can finish on time.

                                So far the project has been a confusing adventure. This week specifically we ran into a lot of issues when we tried to change code in existing projects. We would use sample projects provided by Google and see that they worked with our registered device. The applications would also work when we changed the app id to the id that we got from registering the application. Whenever we tried to change the code in the receiver app the system would no longer work. There is no explanation for this and we are researching possible issues.
                                <br> 
                                <br>We contacted our customer and reached out to Google's cast developer support in hopes that we can figure out this issue. As of now we are at a major roadblock in the project and need to figure out a way to get this past this. The issues could be from registration, github integration issues, or even a hardware issue. At this point we cannot rule anything out. We plan to meet again within the week to troubleshoot more.

                                This first week was very eventful. While there was not much progress made in the actual project, the team was able to get a plan for what they need to do in order to get a satisfied customer.
                                <br>
                                <br>After meeting with the customer, it was decided that the team would first focus on giving an existing game called Centipede Chromecast support. If that was successfully completed, then the team would focus on making their own game that has Chromecast support. Getting the Chromecast to work with a game is the main goal, whether that be our own game or the preexisting one. The team and the customer are getting along well, and the project will be successfully completed if our plan is followed well.
                                <br>
                                <br>The team had a primary meeting on Friday to work on the website and get adjusted to using GitHub as the main communication source. Roxanne taught us how we can use GitHub and what we should do to help with the project. We also discussed future meetings and what we plan to get done at the next meeting. Overall, the team is getting along very well and is appearing to be a very functional team.

                                The team did not meet this week, due to extenuating circumstances. The group divided up parts of the design to work on, to continue to make progress separately. Nate managed to gt a sample working on the chromecast after altering it. It's believed that switching chrome into developer mode or recreating the repository helped.

                                The team met today to further study custom receivers on the chromecast. We looked at several examples provided by the chromecast team. We experimented with the registration process of applications. We also looked at the placement of app ids and namespaces. Applications would work with our registered app ids until the example code was modified. Forums contained no recent posts about developing with the chromecast.

                                Following the assignment of projects, the team met with Chad McQuillen to discuss the goals for the  project. He outlined what he would like to see out of the team for the coming semester, as well as  offered advice and pointers. After the meeting, the team summarized what had been discussed into a list of goals. The list was e-mailed to Chad McQuillen who replyed with an e-mail of approval later that day.
                                <br> The following weekend, on February 4th, Roxanne and I met to start tentative exploration with the chromecast. Our goal was to learn about how the chromecast works with different devices, and experiment with pre-existing chromecast games. While we did not progress to creating our own content for the device, we gained a basic understanding of the mechanics.
                                <br> Our first official team meeting occured on Thursday, February 9th. We created the framework for the project wesite and wrote the first draft for the site content, including the project requirements and schedule. We also synced up our github accounts and reviewed the basics of git.

                                Uploaded several examples to repositories on github to be hosted while running Chromecast examples. Worked with changing app id's, registering different host locations, etc... No examples seem to work after inputing our own code to our custom receivers. Watched several tutorial videos and commented on forums. Seems not a lot of people have been developing with Chromecast Custom Receivers in recent years.

                                Created Netcast repository on Github. Wrote index.html, team.html, updates.html and pushed to repo. Instructed team mates how to download and use git. Integrated javascript to project website. Began researching Custom Receivers through Google Chromecast wiki.
