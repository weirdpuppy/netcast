                            Using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chromecast/?utm_source=chromecast.com">Chromecast</a>, which is a wireless communication device that enables users to display media from one device to a television, implement a web based game that allows the user to use their device as a controller and their television as a display. Our main goal is to update an existing game to add chromecast support. Currently the game is played via a web browser, using keyboard controls. Our project will allow the game to be displayed on a television via a Chromecast and played with a controller displayed via chrome. Our tasks our as follows (in priority order):

                            The Chromecast is a piece of technology developed by Google that streams digital media to a television via a small dongle. This device can be controlled by a mobile phone or a computer. On its own, a Chromecast cannot do many things, but when paired with something else it turns a “dumb” TV into a “smart” TV. The goal of the project is to create a game that can be ran on the chromecast. The controller will be the touch interface of the device and the screen where the actual game is will be the TV. The current goal is to have a chromecast implementation of an existing <a href="http://randolphburt.github.io/Centipede-Angular/">Centipede game</a>. This game is a recreation of the the classic arcade game Centipede. The game will undergo a thorough redesign after the chromecast implementation is done. The plan is to update the graphics, give it a dynamic window size that changes depending on the size of the screen, and add functional home and pause screens.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The main goal of this project is to learn programming with the Chromecast. The online documentation is there, the team just has to find a way to apply all of the information available to the situation at hand. None of the group members have experience developing with the chromecast, so this will be a great learning experience for everyone.
                        </p>

                        <h4> Environment </h4>

                        <p>
                            The environment that will be used for this project is the Chrome Web Browser. The applications that we will be making will be web apps hosted through github. There are many different parts that must work together harmoniously for the project to function correctly. The operating system can be anything that runs chrome smoothly. For testing, we will be using macOS Sierra and Windows 10.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are many different languages that will be intermingling and functioning together. The following will be included in the project: js, html, css. The designs for the sprites will be made in Photoshop and Illustrator.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There will be two separate web pages that will “speak” to each other. They are called the sender and receiver. The sender is the phone or mobile device being used that sends the information and actions to the receiver so that it can handle the information and display actions. Everything for this project will be hosted through github and available on the Chrome web browser.
                        </p>

                            The main purpose of this project is to produce a game that is playable on a television using a Chromecast device. Because of this, there will be an extra focus on the connection between the device and the Chromecast with our testing.

                        <h4> Unit Testing </h4>
                        <p>
                            There are many different modules in the project that must work together to give the finished product. To confirm that all modules are working they will be tested independent from one another. The primary tests for this portion will be as follows, each bullet point is representative for a module being tested:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Connecting the sender module to the receiver module.

                        <h4> Integration Testing </h4>

                        <p>
                            In this stage all of the individual modules will be combined and tested with each other. There is a lot of communication between the separate modules, so it is vital that they all function together properly. The same tests will be conducted as above, but with all of the parts working concurrently. This is what the end user will be using, so full functionality is a necessity. In this step, the combined project will be tested on the most stable platform to ensure that all issues present (if any) are caused due to coding errors.
                        </p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4> System Testing </h4>

                        <p>
                            After full integration is complete, the project as a whole will be analyzed to see whether it meets all specifications and requirements set out at the beginning. The main goal here is to test as many different devices as possible to confirm that the design will function universally. The browser that will be tested is the Chrome browser, as it is the only browser that is officially Chromecast supported. The devices being tested will include: Apple iPhone (Chrome version 57.0.2987.137), Apple MacBook Pro (version 57.0.2987.133), Windows PC (version 57.0.2987.133), Chromebook (version 57.0.2987.146), and Android Phone (version 57.0.2987.132). Extensive testing will be done on all platforms. Some of the platforms do not have any real functionality, but it was chosen to leave them in for continuity. Below, Table 1 contains the results of the testing. The tests being conducted correspond to the individual modules listed above, but altogether this time on multiple platforms.
                            <p>

                                <h4> Customer Testing </h4>


                                <p>
                                    Once all other aspects have been tested, the project will be opened to users. Focus groups will be created that will test the project as a finished product and give us feedback. There will be a wide range of users in these groups, so that we can have the best overall experience for the average person. The main areas we will be looking at in user testing will be: functionality of the game on other devices than what was initially tested, performance for each individual user, and overall quality of the experience for the user. The results of this testing can be found in Table 2 below.
